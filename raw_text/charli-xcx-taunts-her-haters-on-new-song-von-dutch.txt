Charli XCX returns today with “Von dutch,” a boisterous new pop jam that serves as the lead single off her forthcoming sixth studio album, BRAT. Co-written and produced by her “Speed Drive” collaborator EASYFUN and seemingly named for the clothing brand of the same name—you probably had one of their trucker hats in the early 2000s—“Von dutch” finds Charli relishing her status as a topic of conversation.

In the verse that opens the song, Charli taunts some unnamed rival who’s been talking crap all over town. Charli knows the real reason for this slander.


      It’s okay to just admit that you’re jealous of me
Yeah, I heard you talk about me, that’s the word on the street
You’re obsessing, just confess it, put your hands up
It’s obvious, I’m your number one
    

At this point, as we move into the pre-chorus, the drums are still clickety-clackety, and the bass has yet to drop. Charli is still fine with being on the lips of gossip hounds.


      It’s alright to just admit that I’m the fantasy
You’re obsessing, just confess it ’cause it’s obvious
I’m your number one
    

The track swells and throbs on the chorus, as Charli continues boasting and flexing in the face of haters.


      I’m just living that life
Von dutch, cult classic but I still pop
I get money, you get mad because the bank’s shut
Yeah, I know your little secret, put your hands up
    

And so it goes for the rest of the song. “Von dutch” comes with a wild music video filmed at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. Charli rampages through the terminal before wreaking havoc inside a parked plane and eventually tumbling through the baggage claim, disheveled and bloodied.
