No matter how hard you try to create a distance, the bond seems impossible to break. With a remarkably powerful build-up to each chorus to an ethereal bridge, Laufey‚Äôs lyrics and gorgeous melody seals the deal to another beautifully told story that is easily relatable.Expand +12ShareQ&AFind answers to frequently asked questions about the song and explore its deeper meaningAsk a questionWhat did Laufey say about "Promise"?Genius Answer1 contributor‚ÄòPromise‚Äô is a song about that one person you just can‚Äôt quite let go of‚Äîthe person you promise yourself you‚Äôll stop communicating with but always go back to. It‚Äôs a piano ballad written in the form of a story that develops with every verse. Starting with a promise to cut ties with a lover and ending with the inevitable return to the lover.
