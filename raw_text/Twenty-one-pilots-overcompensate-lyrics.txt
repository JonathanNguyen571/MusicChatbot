Wait, what?)(Wait, what? Wait, what?)[Verse 1]Earned my stripes, three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacketBless your ear holes while you react, actingGobsmacked, don't hesitateTo maybe overcompensateI feel like I was just here, same twitchin' in my eyesDon't sleep on a boy who can't fall asleep twiceIn the same night, and won't hesitateTo maybe overcompensateYou might also like[Chorus]I said I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (Wait, what? Wait, what?)Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensateAnd then by the time I catch in my peripheral (Wait, what? Wait, what?)Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate[Verse 2]Where am I from? I was born right here, just nowOriginated right in front of your eyesIf you can't see, I am Clancy, prodigal sonDone running, come up with Josh Dun, wanted dead or aliveSo now you pick who you serve, you bow to the massesGet kicked to the curb for passin' the classesHalf empty, half full, save half for your taxesThen overtake your former self[Chorus]I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (Wait, what? Wait, what?)Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensateAnd then by the time I catch in my peripheral (Wait, what? Wait, what?)Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate[Bridge]Days feel like a perfect lengthI don't need them any longer, but for goodness' sakeDo the years seem way too short for my soul, corazónWay too short for my soul, corazónThe days feel like a perfect lengthI don't need them any longer, but for goodness' sakeDo the years seem way too short for my soul, corazónWay too short for my soul, corazón[Refrain]Earned my stripes, three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacketBless your ear holes while you react, actingGobsmacked, don't hesitateTo maybe overcompensate[Chorus]I said I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (Wait, what?

This song Overcompensate being the first track on the record, it’s gonna be the first song we play live when we start touring. There’s a bit of confidence and a bit of a swagger in it that character really needed to embody in order to take on the new role that the story we’ve been telling and Clancy’s like going to rise up as that person.Who produced “Overcompensate” by ​twenty one pilots?When did ​twenty one pilots release “Overcompensate”?Who wrote “Overcompensate” by ​twenty one pilots?Clancy (2024)​twenty one pilots1.
