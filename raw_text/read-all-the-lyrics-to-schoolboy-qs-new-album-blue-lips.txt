BLUE LIPS





          It’s the acclaimed L.A. rapper’s first album since 2019.
        


ScHoolboy Q returns today with BLUE LIPS, his sixth studio album and first since 2019’s CrasH Talk. The L.A. hip-hop mainstay prefaced the release with the single “Yeern 101,” as well as the music videos for “Bluesides,” “Cooties,” and “Love Birds,” and “Back n Love.”
Guests on the 18-track project include Rico Nasty, Freddie Gibbs, Jozzy, Devin Malik, and ScHoolboy’s Black Hippy compariot Ab-Soul. In a recent interview with the podcast Back on Figg, ScHoolboy elaborated on why he waits so long in between releases.
“When it comes to music, I don’t look at it as like, ‘Oh, you have to drop every year,’” he said. “No, your favorite rapper has to drop every year because he needs [money]. I do what I want because I move off peace, I move off my experiences.”
