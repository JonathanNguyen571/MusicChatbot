          It’s the title track off his second solo mini-album.
        


TAEYONG (태용) of the K-pop boy band NCT returned yesterday with TAP, his second solo mini-album. TAEYONG gets co-writing credit on all six of the project’s songs, and the quirky-funky title track has emerged as an early favorite. It’s currently sitting inside the Top 10 on the Genius Top Songs chart.

“TAP” finds the South Korean idol rapping confidently to a potential love interest. According to a press release, the song “playfully portrays a flirtatious relationship, conveying a message of confidence and cheekily encouraging people to act on their desires.” In the first verse, TAEYONG tells this other person he can’t wait up for them—he’s got to save his energy. (This according to the English translation.) Then he asks, “T.Y., could he be any cuter than this?”


      너를 기다릴 순 없으니
아낄게 기 (Yeah)
T.Y, 이렇게 귀엽긔 있긔 없긔
    

In the pre-chorus, a cocksure TAEYONG declares himself “K-spicy like a pack of bibim noodles,” referencing a popular spicy cold noodle dish from his country.


      Yeah, I’m saucin’
Yeah, I’m saucin’ on you (Hoo)
달콤하고, K-spicy like a 비빔라면 (Ooh, yeah)
You addicted, I addicted
    

In the chorus, TAEYONG describes a situation where he and this other person stare awkwardly at each other. The meaning of the phrase “tapping on me” isn’t immediately obvious, but it seems to be something like “paying attention to me.” (It could have something to do with all the tapping on screens we do these days.)


      Tap, tap, tap, tap
Tapping on me (Yeah)
멋쩍게 쳐다보고
지나가지 슬그머니
달라보이지 그렇겠지
그럼 난 물끄러미
아무것도 모른다는
표정을 짓지 (Yeah)
    

TAEYONG is less coy in the second verse. He tells this person he’s typing to her, and that she’s his “hype girl.” Then he encourages her to live without a rulebook and do whatever she wants to do.


      Keep tapping on me, I’m typing to you, 빨라진 tempo
잘 알지 너의 type, 너만이 나의 hype girl
Check my new world
Don’t need manuals (Yeah)
너가 원하는 대로 따라해봐
    

“TAP” arrives with a splashy, hyper-colorful music video filmed in Japan and filled with cultural signifiers from that country. It’s apparently generated some controversy.
