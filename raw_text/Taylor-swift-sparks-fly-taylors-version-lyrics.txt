Due to the demand from fans after a performance of the song was uploaded to YouTube, Taylor decided to rework it and put it on Speak Now. The hints that the track is about Jake are more noticeable in the original lyrics.
Fast forward to 2023, she played this song on her “Eras Tour” as a surprise song, accompained by her guitar. However, to introduce the song, she announced her long-awaited album Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), saying the following:
“I’ve been planning something for a while. You know how I love to plan things and you know how I love to surprise you with the things I’ve been planning. It’s my love language with you. You know. I plot, I scheme, I plan and then I get to tell you about it.
Rather than me speaking about it, I though I would just show you”Expand +13ShareQ&AFind answers to frequently asked questions about the song and explore its deeper meaningAsk a questionHow did the song perform commercially?Genius Answer1 contributorDuring the chart tracking week ending July 22, 2023, the song debuted at #22 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.Who produced “Sparks Fly (Taylor's Version)” by Taylor Swift?When did Taylor Swift release “Sparks Fly (Taylor's Version)”?Who wrote “Sparks Fly (Taylor's Version)” by Taylor Swift?Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) (2023)Taylor Swift1.
