The track was initially titled “H00LIGANS” and previewed at the Las Vegas VULTURES Rave on December 15, 2023. The released version, featuring a new choir backing, instrumental, Ye verse, Carti verse, and an altered Rich The Kid verse, was debuted at the United Center in Chicago during VULTURES 1’s first official listening party.
Ye samples his own song “Hell of a Life” due to the original Ozzy Osbourne sample not being cleared. Ozzy’s disproval was announced via an X outburst, which Ye has thought not to be written by Ozzy himself but instead a celebrity handler.
The CARNIVAL PACK—featuring separate versions of “CARNIVAL"—was released in promotion of the track. It introduced a separate cover, and also propelled the track to the third spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 song chart.
The song serves as a provocative commentary on the excesses of celebrity and material culture, challenging listeners to reflect on the values and consequences of a life driven by hedonism, materialism, and the relentless pursuit of pleasure. Through explicit lyrics and vivid imagery, the song critiques the superficial markers of success in contemporary society, questioning the sustainability and moral implications of such a lifestyle while simultaneously reveling in its allure and immediate gratifications.Expand +2191ShareQ&AFind answers to frequently asked questions about the song and explore its deeper meaningAsk a questionAlternative CoverGenius Answer1 contributorHow did the song perform commercially?Genius Answer1 contributorDuring the tracking week ending February 24, 2024, the song debuted at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song becomes Kanye’s 21st Hot 100 top 10 and Ty Dolla $ign’s third.Was there controversy over the sampling in the song?Genius Answer2 contributorsOn February 9, 2024, 1 day before “CARNIVAL” officially dropped, Ozzy Osbourne, lead vocalist of the band Black Sabbath, announced on Twitter that Ye had been using a sample from his song, “Iron Man,” without permission.
@KANYEWEST ASKED PERMISSION TO SAMPLE A SECTION OF A 1983 LIVE PERFORMANCE OF “IRON MAN” FROM THE US FESTIVAL WITHOUT VOCALS & WAS REFUSED PERMISSION BECAUSE HE IS AN ANTISEMITE AND HAS CAUSED UNTOLD HEARTACHE TO MANY. HE WENT AHEAD AND USED THE SAMPLE ANYWAY AT HIS ALBUM LISTENING PARTY LAST NIGHT. I WANT NO ASSOCIATION WITH THIS MAN!
Ye then replaced the “Iron Man” sample with his own song, “Hell Of A Life,” which itself samples “Iron Man.”Who produced “CARNIVAL” by ¥$, Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign & Rich The Kid?When did ¥$, Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign & Rich The Kid release “CARNIVAL”?Who wrote “CARNIVAL” by ¥$, Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign & Rich The Kid?CARNIVAL PACK (2024)¥$, Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign & Rich The Kid1.
