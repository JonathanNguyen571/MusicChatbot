          Lil Yachty guests on “Lego Ring.”
        


Atlanta singer-songwriter Faye Webster returns today with her fifth studio album, Underdressed at the Symphony, the follow-up to 2021’s acclaimed I Know I’m Funny haha. The LP includes the singles “But Not Kiss,” “Lifetime,” “Feeling Good Today,” and “Lego Ring,” which features her good pal Lil Yachty.
As Webster told Rolling Stone AU/NZ, Underdressed was inspired by a breakup, though there’s plenty of her trademark humor in the mix.
“During that period of my life, I would find myself going to the symphony a lot,” Webster said, explaining the album title. “When it came to naming the record, it just felt like the most meaning[sic] thing I could relate to.”
