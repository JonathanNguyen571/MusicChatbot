          The track dates back more than a decade.
        


Miley Cyrus is not a doctor, but she plays one on her new single. Produced and co-written by Pharrell Williams, “Doctor (Work It Out)” is actually a pretty old song. Cyrus and Pharrell recorded it back in 2012 for Miley’s Bangerz album, but it didn’t make the cut. Now more than a decade later, the pair are releasing the slinky, bluesy disco-rock jam into what they hope will be a receptive world.

“We just believe so much in timing and in everything happening when it’s supposed to,” Miley told Apple Music 1, as Pitchfork reports. “And around the Grammys, Pharrell and I were talking about putting the song out, and it just felt like it was so serendipitous, and there were so many alignments and so many moments that made me know that now was the perfect time.”
After one of Pharrell’s signature four-count intros, “Doctor” hits listeners with four-on-the-floor drums, a repetitive guitar riff, and some playfully sexy lyrics from Dr. Cyrus.


      ​​I could be your doctor
And I could be your nurse
I think I see the problem
It’s only gon’ get worse
    

That was the first part of the chorus. The second doubles down on the sex-as-healthcare metaphor.


      A midnight medication
Just show me where it hurts
I need to rock you, baby
Before your body bursts
    

In the first and only verse, Miley elaborates on the type of therapy she’s prepared to offer.


      You’re my lover (You’re my lover)
I show you sympathy
Take your sugar (Take your sugar)
And pour it into me
    

Miley ditches the MD conceit in the bridge and gets right to the point. She’s looking for some no-strings fun. Is this other person in or out?


      Are you on the fence?
I’ll slip but I won’t slide
Don’t gotta be forever
Just together for the night
    

In the “Doctor (Work It Out)” music video, Miley dances around in a sparkly dress while showing off the feathery hairdo she rocked at the Grammys.
