          It’s the second single off her forthcoming album ‘Deeper Well.’
        


Kacey Musgraves returns today with “Too Good To Be True,” the second single off her forthcoming fifth album, Deeper Well, due out March 15. Like its predecessor, the LP’s title track, “Too Good To Be True” has a sparse, folky feel that signals a departure from her last album, 2021’s sonically adventurous star-crossed.
​​
Musgraves wrote and produced “Too Good To Be True” with her longtime collaborators Daniel Tashian and O Day of Rest and Gladness. (Anna Nalick also gets a writing credit.) The song opens with gentle acoustic guitar and a description of a pretty decent little autumn morning.


      Made some breakfast, made some love
This is what dreams are made of
On a cloudy Monday morning
Summer’s gone and you’re still here
    

Musgraves ends the verse by saying it’s “been a year,” and while she doesn’t specifically mention any of her past heartache, it’s clear she’s nervous about falling back in love.


      Please don’t make me regret
Opening up that part of myself
That I’ve been scared to give again
Be good to me and ’’ll be good to you
But please don’t be too good to be true
    

The second verse moves us to a place where so many people go for new beginnings.


      In my mind, we’re in New York
You had never been before
But, baby, now it’s our town
    

Kacey admits things are moving quickly. But she likes the feeling. It’s not in her nature to pump the breaks.


      I’ll admit that I’m in deep
That I don’t know how else to be
And I don’t wanna slow down
    

Musgraves has also announced a world tour that begins in Dublin on April 28 and wraps in Nashville on December 7.
