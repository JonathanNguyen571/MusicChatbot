In an instant, the song sets a stage that appears somehow more magical than the album‚Äôs other accompanying singles. The dreamy instrumentals, romantic chord progression, and of course her timeless vocal tone actively casts a spell over the listener. Laufey never fails to encapsulate each emotion she wishes to convey through her impeccable story-like lyrics. Through Bewitched, she introduces a tale of new love and expresses the feelings of passion, hesitancy, and just how bewildering the experience could be.
