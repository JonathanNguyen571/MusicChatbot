There was a country song I heard that pained my heart so much and would bring me to tears because it resonated so much. I'm in therapy healing from a lifetime of pain and trauma. Since this song has stuck in my head so long after, my therapist thinks it will be really good to find the song so we can listen to it while working through it. I can't remember it well enough, other than the deep feelings of sorrow and can't find it online. I believe it was in a music video where a young girl was in the backseat looking out the back window waving and crying as they drove away. The mom said something about how hard it is saying goodbye or letting go... or maybe it was the childs grown up self as it carried over into adulthood. I can't grasp the actual words used, but something like that. more »LikeReply6 days agorhj53e7hSomething that goes "please, stay" --> goes high pitched, there's a beat, and then stayy.I think there's also something like 'can we just TALK about this' or 'can we not TALK about this'.My guess is that it's a song within the past 5 years? more »LikeReply6 days agoNoName123I'm looking for a song that I've recently heard many times, but only at a local basketball gym.

I’ve been trying to figure this out for seriously over 20 YEARS. If I recall correctly, the CD label/sticker was brown. There appear to be multiple male singers that are African American. The album probably came out in the 80’s or early 90’s because I found the CD as a child in approximately 1994-1996. Thank you so much for your help. For some reason nothing pops up on searches for any of these lyrics. more »LikeReply 123 days agoalbertog.25610Ok this is the music video.

It's in 6/8 time, and most of the song has the same chord changes as Unchained Melody (the classic C/Am/F/G7). There is a bridge section, twice, where the chord progression changes. At the end of the bridge, the backing vocalists can be heard singing either 'No, no' or 'No more.' At the end of the song the lead begins talking rather than singing during which part he mentions that he'd rather not be 'peeling potatoes.'

I heard it couple of weeks ago in a clothing store, but Soundhound didn’t recognise it. I don’t know if it’s old or new, but can’t find it with search engines. He is telling about the things how he’s going to treat the woman right. I remember the chorus being ”When I do something, I do it right” but not sure how it continues, might be something about making sweet or good loving to you every night. At least that kind of thing was somewhere in the song. I remember one part was something about When I’m with you I don’t use (or check) my phone because that would be rude.

It had a line in it that I vaguely remember, "And the Portugese Fisherman he/I will come home". Something like that. Very soft tune. Bit melancholy. Just loved that song for some inexplicable reason.

I know my sisters and I each had one.  One of us had the lime doll. I used to play the record for that one constantly. Part of the song popped into my head the other day and now it won't  go away. Part of the lyrics  were "I'm as happy as Lime, floating in a boat that's full of lemon ice cream.

The opening line was something like "You say let's get the car and go down to the bar" (the words car and bar spoken with a New Jersey or New York accent). The second line was "Well we call them cars and bars down here in Texas" (the words cars and bars spoken with a Texas accent)The best I can remember is the song was more about the differences between Texas and New Jersey, New York or the northern states, like speech, customs, and so on.

The name had one of these words in it or something similar (shadow, dark, night, or angel) something to that effect. The music video was basically like the lead singer singing and through the video he was seen either chasing or being chased by a man in all dark clothing. pretty sure he wore a black hood as well and at one point was running down a set of train tracks.

So the first time I have heard it was in an Alicia Online (thats a horse game) video, in wich it was the backround song. The video showed secret areas or bugs or something like that in the game Alicia Online. I played that around 2 years ago. I cannot find that specific video again, literally, I have searched all over youtube (it was posted on youtube). Also, the video (I think) was posted by an account named something like Minu, Mizu or anything like that. In the video in the game she wrode a dark (darkbrown maby?) horse and showed around 7 or 10 secret locations in the game. To the song its self, like I said I have heard it as the backround song in that video for the first time, sang along to it as well. Then I must have managed to find the name of that song just by listening to it (my english was NOT good around that time since I was pretty young and Im german!). I remember searching it up, finding it on youtube and listening to it on repeat. The thing is, that I don’t actually remember a lot of details about the song itself. I know that it was sang by a man and I think a woman as well, but mostly by the man and the woman’s voice more in the backround. Also, the man had a kind of high voice, so not like the singer from the Imagine Dragons for an example, but more like the singer of „your body language speaks to me“, you know? Then I know that kind of at the end of the refrain the singer repeated ether the word „body“ or „baby“, with repeated I mean the word was like sung normal and then was kind of repeated as an echo? But not like a smooth, fading echo, but more just like a little bit more quiet than the first singing. Also, I thiiink that ether the song name or the writer or just anything from the title had the letter S at the beginning or at least somewhere in the title, but I am not sure about it. Also, Im not sure about that either, but the lyrics video backround was like grey but with some red as well, like a grey splittered wall with some red?! I don’t really know, again, Im not sure about this. Also, the song was not slow, it was not really rock, more like pop, but not like a happy poppy one, I kind of don’t know. Also, it was NOT a song from the ESC, a VERRY old song or a song that is REALLY trendy today I think. But sadly I cannot remember any sort of melody or anything else than what I just talked about. I also have NO way of getting that song back, but I know that I loved it so much (don’t ask why I forgot about it then…)! I hope that anyone may recognize that song! Ty!

Something must be wrong... I heard this song that i believe it was playing in a Youtube ad. the song was so fire that i didnt even bother to check the name of the song on the spot because i thought it was so fire that for sure for sure it was going to be a hit or that it would be easy to find because the song was fire. I was playing COD Warzone too while it started playing off of my phone and here i am all this time kinda irritated and not believing that i just cant find it. Now that that im going thru this little struggle i really think that something super odd mustve happened. Maybe for some rights or for some reason this song i just cant find it. Its not on Youtube google bla bla bla... The chorus of the song was saying... "To the Gulag with your ass! Boy you some trash! To the Gulag with your ass Boy you is trash!" It had like a trap beat.

However, knowing my father, who is the reason I ever heard it, it likely originated some time in the 80s or 90s. more »LikeReply1 year agoChrisCurryHit from 80s by female  that includes the line: How could something that feels so right be wrongLikeReply1 year agogideon_gI have the same song in my head.

It was about a passenger jet that needed to make an emergency landing at an unlit airport at night. The pilot was a former truck driver so he sent out a call for help from trucks in the area. The call went out and all the trucks in the area went to the airport and lined up along the runway to light it so they could land safely. I've remembered the chorus for 40+ years, but I don't know the name of the song or the artist. The chorus goes "Break, break on the interstate you guys on Ole one-nine. We've got an old good buddy in a bind. Break, break on the interstate and switch to channel nine. She's coming down and we ain't got much time." Any info on the song or the artist would be greatly appreciated.

I was listening to a radio one night (probably RTE Lyric FM) and they played a really beautiful song. It was kinda staticky when I listened to it but I still managed to make it out. I don't know the song name or artist because I was tired and didn't really pay attention to what the person on the radio was saying about the song when it ended, which means I don't even know the artist name. Also, I've tried searching the Internet but I couldn't find anything, it just shows random things that don't even match. I can't remember what the song was called either.Here's my description of the song so you can try to find it:- The singer is female- The genre of the song is probably opera or classical (somewhere along those lines)- The whole song itself is in the key of D minor- The lyrics that were sung repeatedly were, "One day I will be gone" (something like that)- The song tempo is a relatively slow one, it's not upbeat- I remember that the instruments were a group of strings and a piano- Near the end of the song (probably a vocalise section), the vocals were singing in the whistle note range (something like "oooooh", I can't really remember?) - After that 'vocalise' section near the end, the piano plays a beautiful melody and ends in a sharp discord (D Minor probably)That's all I can remember about the song.

P. Arnold (two albums in the late '60s; she had the first major hit on "The First Cut Is the Deepest"), Ruth Copeland (two LPs in the early '70s), and ex-pat American Merry Clayton (who had two early '70s LPs, and is well-known for her vocal on the Rolling Stones' "Gimme Shelter."  There were also folkier blues females in the UK during that period, such as Sandy Denny (who died in 1978) and Vashti Bunyan (whose first LP in 1970 was also her last for 35 years).

Armstrong?LikeReply1 year agoDComposeI"m looking for a song that seems to have sampled Ian Dury and blockheads 'Hit me with your rhythm stick", but it's not that. I heard it in the early 90s, sounded like a rap band, loud bass. I've done numerous searches always find the same suggestions on google. The answer to this one won't be on google as I exhausted it already, this will need to be someone that remembers the actual song. I heard it on a mixtape that my buddy had. here are the lyrics I remember:I'm gonna Hit you, Hit you, Hit you.. (then there was a loud noise in the song, like DUM DUM) with my little stick! Hit you Hit You Hit YOu (dum dum) with my little stick.. (this seemed to be the chorus and was song very loud).Dance.. move your feet,.. dance!... hit you.. hit you!that's all I remember from the lyrics. It definitely reminds me of Ian drury, but it's not them. definitely a rapper singing it and the bass is SUPER loud. the song starts with just loud bass. it was soo awesome, haven't heard it since like 1994/95, any help would be GREATLY APPRECIATED :) more »LikeReply1 year agojaned.00968Do The Freak- Bootsy Collins?LikeReply1 year agoaugfuvltrying to find the song in this tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@demiefxe/video/7072055668177407237?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id6987449725587965446LikeReply1 year agoaldomac3trying to find the song at the end of episode 1 of the holiday on channel 5-some words are "youre all we have-a female singingLikeReply1 year ago=_Popcorn_=Oki so its a male voice, pretty well known (kinda deep voice actually)and goes something along these lines (Idk how to spell the 5th word mk I think thats the name of the song but anyways-)"cmon now do the touchediggg- n cowboys running with sweet----" yep thats all I got.Its also a song that was really well known in 2019, and has a dance that goes to it. more »LikeReply1 year agoHere2help101I assume you're talking about a song that used to be popular on tiktok in the summer of 2019 that goes; "C'mon do the 2 step and then cowboy boogie"?

I don't remember the name of the artist, the song, or the record, only a couple lines from one of the songs. It was about a woman finding a fawn curled beside it's mother, that had died beside the creek in the woods behind her house. She took care of the fawn for almost a year, feeding it and sheltering it, until it finally got old enough and strong enough to take off on her. She sings to it as it leaves, realizing how lonely she's going to be after it's gone. The part I can remember went: "Please come back little deer, you're my friend and companion out here. Come back to stay, come back any day, it's lonesome without you out here." I lost that cassette tape YEARS ago, and have spent so much time since trying to find that song again, but no one else I know seems to have ever heard of it. The particularly frustrating part, is that the woman who put the record out WASN'T anyone really especially famous. Pretty sure that was the ONLY record she ever put out. It made an impact on me, though, so I'd love to be able to find it again. more »LikeReply2 years agok87654321wKind of a country/folk type song, sung by a woman.

Come back to stay, come back any day, it's lonesome without you out here." Song is about an elderly woman that takes care of a fawn whose mother died beside the creek, until it gets older and stronger and leaves her. I'm pretty sure the artist wasn't anyone terribly famous, but she DID put out at least the one record, because I had it on cassette tape. Lost it years ago, though. more »LikeReply2 years agoRthomp88Little Deer- SpellingLikeReply2 years agok87654321wI got very excited when I saw your reply, and looked it up immediately. Unfortunately, while the song you directed me to IS an interesting one, with all sorts of fascinating layers and background things happening... it's not the same one I'm thinking of. The song I'm trying to find is much simpler: just one woman's voice, accompanied ONLY by an acoustic guitar. No pianos, drums, or anything else. The song had a definite "rural" sound to it, a folk/country flavor. I remember the singer's voice as sounding quite a bit older than the Spelling artist you suggested, with a very strong regional accent that would place her somewhere in the American Southeast.

In it's music video theres a man on a cliff with probably a sword in his hand, he seems to shout something (like a call to arms/war) and jumps into water. Then it starts to play the music which seems to sound quite "chinese" to me when my father hums it. He told me its around the 80th when he heard it the last time. He also said that in the refrain you can hear something that sounds like "Maria". Even with all these hints, i couldnt find the song.

Any help is aprecited so thanks in advance!I believe the song was around 2010s at oldest and I believe it's at least 5 years old or older. I heard it on YouTube and the music video didn't really look that old but I didn't look at the date of release at all.I can't remember any of the lyrics but I know that the music video showed a dude being served a bunch of pastries (I think they kinda looked like eclairs and I'm pretty sure they were powdered) and really just eating them throughout the whole thing. And the girl serving him the pastries is almost babying him in a way as if he was a small child when he's in fact a grown man. I think the underlying message of the song or like the meanig of the lyrics also had something to do with the whole 'dating a man and having to take care of him as if he were a child'.I think there might have been some electric guitar and drums but I'm not quite sure. I suck at musical genres so this guess will probably be off but I think it was pop though it could have also been pulling some slight alternative rock vibes but I'm not so sure about that.I know this isn't a lot to go on but if for some reason this rings any bells I'd appreciate it if you helped me out!

Their version is still my all time favorite.The song was originally written by Jim Pepper, Native American songwriter & jazz saxophonist (now deceased). There are several You Tube videos of the song by Brewer & Shipley, Mr. Pepper and other artists.It is worth checking out the 'back story' of "Witchi Tai To" on the duo's website www.brewerandshipley.com and how they came by the song. Many would recognize their biggest hit from the early 70's, "One Toke Over The Line" but their talent goes way beyond that one song. I've always been a fan of their works.Once you are on their website, click on "Songs" in the bottom bar, next click on "Witchi Tai To" from the song list, then on the lyrics page click on  "About Witchi Tai To" to get the whole story. more »LikeReply2 years agoUxorialThe blue light is shining, shining again.

Aaww, we do, we do, we do. Aaww, we do, we do, we do'2/ One hit wonder, not certain. May be an obscure song of an established band. '68 to '73. Male vocalist. Soft rock/pop. 'Where will the words come from when I tell you I don't want you, I don't need you any more'3/ This is the one I want the most. Not much to go on. 1980's. Rock. Male vocalist with a low voice. From a moderately successful rock band who may have had a few albums and hits in the 1980's. Definitely from the 1980's. Singer is trying to talk a girl into going to a motel with him to do the nasty with her. Something like...'It's the cheapest motel baby. It's right down the avenue"4/ I believe the song was released between 2012 and 2017. This band had two hits. This was one. This was (IMHO) a very catchy , well composed and produced song. I can't recall any exact lyrics. Male singer. He mentions a dagger in a church (coming down on him). It's about not fitting in and paying the price. I was surprised at how little play this good song got.My previous must find that was found. 'Roses are red my love, baby violets are blue......So stand by me, and our love will grow stronger' Someone suggested Bobby Vinton. No, I quickly replied.
