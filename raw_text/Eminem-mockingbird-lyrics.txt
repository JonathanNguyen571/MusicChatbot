Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know itWe're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirlsWhen it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girlsLookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' youDaddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the newsI try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seemsThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on meAll the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to seeDaddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he didWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and meBut things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagersBut then, of course, everything always happens for a reasonI guess it was never meant to beBut it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny isBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleepMaybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dreamYou might also like[Chorus]Now hush, little baby, don't you cryEverything's gonna be alrightStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told yaDaddy's here to hold ya through the nightI know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know whyWe feel how we feel insideIt may seem a little crazy, pretty babyBut I promise Mama's gon' be alright[Verse 2]Heh, it's funnyI remember back one year when Daddy had no moneyMommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the treeAnd said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'emI'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a jobBut his job was to keep the food on the table for you and MomAnd at the time, every house that we lived inEither kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the blockAnd your Mom was savin' money for you in a jarTryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to collegeAlmost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole itAnd I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heartAnd it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apartMom and Dad was arguin' a lotSo Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartmentAnd Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on NovaraAnd that's when Daddy went to California with his CDAnd met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see meBut Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave meThen you started seein' Daddy on the TVAnd Mama didn't like itAnd you and Lainie were too young to understand itPapa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habitAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab itI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proudNow I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me outTo see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters nowWow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still hereLainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still hereI like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment[Chorus]Now hush, little baby, don't you cryEverything's gonna be alrightStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told yaDaddy's here to hold ya through the nightI know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know whyWe feel how we feel insideIt may seem a little crazy, pretty babyBut I promise Mama's gon' be alright[Outro]And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbirdI'ma give you the worldI'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for youI'll do anything for you to see you smileAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shineI'ma break that birdie's neckI'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to yaAnd make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad!

Eminem acknowledges that growing up with his media image and Kim’s drug problem made for a difficult upbringing, not to mention their poverty-stricken beginnings. The lyrics are a personal, undisguised account of his early relationship with his wife and daughters. Critics praised the song for its lyrics. This song mixes an original rap dialogue about Eminem’s failed marriage, as he apologizes to his daughters with a straight melodic version of the traditional “Mockingbird” lullaby called “Hush, Little Baby”. The second verse is about the difficulties including Kim and Eminem’s divorce and the beginning of Eminem’s fame.Expand +79236ShareQ&AFind answers to frequently asked questions about the song and explore its deeper meaningAsk a questionWhat did Eminem say about "Mockingbird"?Genius Answer1 contributor[There’s a Hailie love song on Encore.] A song called “Mockingbird,” to Hailie and Alaina. When Mom was on the run they didn’t understand it, and I’m not the greatest talker in the world, especially when I’m trying to explain to two little girls what’s goin' on with someone who’s always been a part of their life and just disappeared. So that was my song to explain to them what was goin' on, probably the most emotional song I ever wrote.
